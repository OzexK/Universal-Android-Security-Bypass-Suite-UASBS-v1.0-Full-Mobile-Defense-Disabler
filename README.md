## üöÄ Overview

**Universal Android Security Bypass Suite v1.0** is a powerful, modular **Frida-based instrumentation toolkit** designed for advanced penetration testers, mobile red team operators, and professional security researchers.

It provides full-spectrum evasion of Android application security controls by dynamically detecting and disabling protection mechanisms **at runtime**, supporting both **Java** and **native** layers.

> **Disclaimer:** This tool is intended **ONLY** for authorized red teaming, vulnerability assessments, and security research under legal contracts and engagements. Do not use for malicious purposes.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Edit the `CONFIG` object at the top of the script to enable/disable features:

```js
const CONFIG = {
    verbose: true,         // Show all logs in console
    crashSafe: true,       // Wrap all hooks in try/catch
    autoBypass: true,      // Automatically apply bypass hooks
    stealthMode: true,     // Anti-Frida and Anti-Emulator stealth
    discoveryMode: false,  // Enable dynamic class/method enumeration
    detailedOutput: true   // Show descriptions for each hook
};
```

## üì¶ Usage

> üß† You must have Frida installed on your PC and Frida server running on the Android device.

```bash
# Connect to USB device and spawn target app
frida -U -n com.target.app -l Universal-Android-Security-Bypass-Suite-UASBS-v1.0-Full-Mobile-Defense-Disabler.js

# OR attach to already running process
frida -U -p <PID> -l Universal-Android-Security-Bypass-Suite-UASBS-v1.0-Full-Mobile-Defense-Disabler.js
```

Optional (enable logs):

```bash
frida -U -n com.target.app -l universal_bypass.js --runtime=v8
```

## üß™ Tested Protections Bypassed

- RootBeer Library
- SafetyNet API & Integrity API
- Frida Detection (common + custom)
- Emulator detection (LDPlayer, Bluestacks, Nox, Genymotion)
- Tamper protection
- SSL Pinning (TrustManager, WebViewClient, TrustKit)
- VPN Detection
